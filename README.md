# Covid-Impact-on-Stocks
# Business Problem Definition:

We want to show how various industries in response to global disasters, and in this project, we have selected COVID -19 to display this.

Our project is dedicated to understanding the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various industries by conducting a thorough analysis of stock market data. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Investigate the stock price variations of industries before, during and after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying trends, and assessing the extent of market disruption.
2. Post-COVID-19 Performance: Our research will extend beyond the pandemic's immediate effects. We will assess how industries have performed in the post-COVID-19 era, allowing us to measure their resilience and adaptability in the face of ongoing challenges.
3. Investment Recommendations: Based on our findings, we will provide insightful recommendations on which industries are most suitable for various types of investment. This will include identifying sectors that have shown stability, growth potential, or unique investment opportunities in the new normal.
4. Comparative Analysis: Our analysis will involve comparative studies between industries, enabling us to highlight relative performance and potential cross-sector investment strategies.

Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented challenges and disruptions across industries. We are motivated to embark on this project to shed light on how companies navigated these turbulent times. Analyzing stock market data during and after the pandemic will provide valuable insights into the resilience and adaptability of businesses, aiding investors in making informed decisions and policymakers in shaping future strategies.

Challenges:

Some of our challenges included dealing with a large dataset that contained similar categorical and numerical columns.

Also, we experienced frequent runtime crashes because of our visualizations inputting large quantities of prices and stock dates.

Understanding the underlying aspects in our portfolio creation.
